**Code:**
```java
class Example {
  private final int x;

  public Example(int x) {
    this.x = x;
  }

  public boolean isEven() {
    return x % 2 == 0;
  }

  public boolean isOdd() {
    return !isEven();
  }
}
```

**Testing:**

* **Static testing:**
   - No issues found.
* **Code reviews:**
   - The `isOdd()` method is redundant as it can be replaced with `!isEven()`.
* **Static code analysis:**
   - No issues found.
* **Code linting:**
   - No issues found.
* **Code complexity:**
   - The code is simple and easy to understand.
* **Code dependencies:**
   - No issues found.

**Corrections:**

* The `isOdd()` method has been removed.

**Detailed Review:**

* **Error:** The `isOdd()` method was redundant.
* **Fix:** The `isOdd()` method has been removed.
* **Reason:** The `isOdd()` method can be replaced with `!isEven()`, which is more concise and easier to read.

**Fixed Code:**
```java
class Example {
  private final int x;

  public Example(int x) {
    this.x = x;
  }

  public boolean isEven() {
    return x % 2 == 0;
  }
}
