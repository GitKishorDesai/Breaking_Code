## Static Testing and Code Reviews

### Static Testing

- **eslint:** Linted the code using eslint to identify potential coding errors and adherence to coding standards.
- **stylelint:** Linted the CSS styles using stylelint to ensure consistency and adherence to best practices.
- **dependency-cruiser:** Analyzed the code for dependency issues, including circular dependencies and excessive dependencies.

### Code Reviews

- Performed manual code reviews to identify potential issues in logic, design, and implementation.
- Identified areas where the code could be simplified, refactored, or improved in terms of maintainability and readability.

## Corrections and Improvements

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug in the `getUpcomingHoliday` function where the `tradingDate` property was being incorrectly used in the comparison.
- Fixed a bug in the `GLTable` component where the `refreshGL` prop was not being passed correctly from the parent component.

### Improvements

- **Reduced code complexity:** Refactored the `getMarketStatus` and `getMarketHolidays` functions to make them more concise and easier to understand.
- **Removed unnecessary dependencies:** Removed the `moment` dependency, which was no longer being used in the code.
- **Improved error handling:** Added error handling to the `getMarketStatus`, `refreshMarketStatus`, and `getMarketHolidays` functions to handle potential errors and provide more helpful error messages.
- **Optimized code for performance:** Implemented memoization to the `getUpcomingHoliday` function to improve performance by caching the result of the function.

## Detailed Review

### Errors Found

- The `getUpcomingHoliday` function was incorrectly using the `tradingDate` property for comparison, which could lead to incorrect results.
- The `GLTable` component was not receiving the `refreshGL` prop correctly, which prevented the table from being refreshed properly.

### Fixes and Improvements

- The `getUpcomingHoliday` function was modified to use the correct `tradingDate` property for comparison.
- The `GLTable` component was updated to receive the `refreshGL` prop correctly, ensuring proper table refresh functionality.
- The code complexity was reduced by refactoring the `getMarketStatus` and `getMarketHolidays` functions to make them more concise and easier to understand.
- The `moment` dependency was removed as it was no longer needed.
- Error handling was added to the `getMarketStatus`, `refreshMarketStatus`, and `getMarketHolidays` functions to handle potential errors and provide more helpful error messages.
- Memoization was implemented in the `getUpcomingHoliday` function to improve performance by caching the result of the function.

### Reasoning Behind Changes

- The fix for the `getUpcomingHoliday` function ensures that the correct `tradingDate` property is used for comparison, providing accurate results for upcoming holidays.
- The fix for the `GLTable` component ensures that the table can be refreshed properly, providing a better user experience and ensuring that the table data is up-to-date.
- The reduction in code complexity makes the code easier to understand and maintain, reducing the likelihood of errors.
- The removal of the `moment` dependency eliminates unnecessary dependency and simplifies the codebase.
- The addition of error handling provides better feedback to the user and helps identify and resolve errors more quickly.
- The implementation of memoization in the `getUpcomingHoliday` function improves performance by reducing unnecessary function calls.
