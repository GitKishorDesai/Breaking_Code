## 1. Code Testing & Analysis

### 1.1. Static Testing

- **Code linting:** Using ESLint, code linting was performed to check for adherence to coding standards and best practices. A few minor errors were identified and corrected.
- **Code complexity analysis:** The code was analyzed using the Refractor tool to identify areas with high complexity. The function `getHistoricalScripData` was found to be complex and suggestions were made to refactor it.
- **Dependency analysis:** The code was analyzed using tools to identify any excessive or inappropriate dependencies. No issues were found in this regard.

### 1.2. Code Reviews

- **Logic review:** The code was reviewed to identify any potential issues in logic, design, or implementation. A few minor issues were identified and corrected.
- **Security review:** The code was reviewed to identify any potential security vulnerabilities. No major vulnerabilities were found, but a few best practices were suggested to enhance security.

## 2. Code Corrections and Improvements

### 2.1. Code Corrections

- Fixed minor linting errors identified during static testing.
- Clarified the logic in the `getDateXDaysAgo` function to handle cases where the provided number of days is zero or negative.
- Adjusted the formatting of the `toDate` and `fromDate` variables to ensure they are always in the correct format for the API request.

### 2.2. Code Improvements

- Refactored the `getHistoricalScripData` function to make it more readable and maintainable:
    - Extracted the logic for fetching data from the API into a separate `fetchData` function.
    - Added error handling for the API request and improved the error message.
- Added a retry mechanism to the `fetchData` function to improve robustness.
- Added a loading state to the component to indicate when data is being fetched.
- Updated the chart height to be more responsive based on the available space.

## 3. Detailed Review of Errors and Improvements

### 3.1. Errors Fixed

- **Linting errors:** Minor code style and formatting issues were resolved.
- **Handling of date variables:** The `toDate` and `fromDate` variables were modified to ensure they are always in the correct format for the API request.
- **API request error handling:** Error handling was added to the `getHistoricalScripData` function to provide a better user experience in case of API errors.

### 3.2. Improvements Made

- **Function refactoring:** The `getHistoricalScripData` function was refactored to improve readability and maintainability.
- **API retry mechanism:** A retry mechanism was added to the `fetchData` function to enhance robustness and reduce the likelihood of chart data not being displayed due to temporary network issues.
- **Loading state:** A loading state was added to the component to provide visual feedback to users while data is being fetched.
- **Responsive chart height:** The chart height was updated to be more responsive based on the available space, ensuring the chart fits well in different screen sizes.
