1. **Testing the Code**

**Static Testing**

- **Code reviews:** There is a lack of comments and documentation in the code, making it difficult to understand the purpose and functionality of various sections.
- **Static code analysis:** The code is unnecessarily verbose and contains several redundant lines, which can be simplified to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Code linting:** The code does not adhere to consistent coding standards, which can lead to inconsistencies and errors.
- **Code complexity:** The code has several instances of excessive nesting and long methods, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain.
- **Code dependencies:** The code has several unnecessary dependencies, which can bloat the bundle size and introduce potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Correcting the Code**

**Fixes**

- **Added comments and documentation:** Added comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of various sections of the code.
- **Simplified code:** Simplified the code by removing redundant lines and unnecessary verbosity to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Enforced coding standards:** Enforced consistent coding standards to ensure consistency and prevent errors.
- **Reduced code complexity:** Reduced code complexity by breaking down long methods and reducing nesting levels.
- **Optimized dependencies:** Optimized dependencies by removing unnecessary ones and replacing them with more efficient alternatives.

3. **Detailed Review**

The following issues were found during the testing and analysis phases:

- **Lack of comments and documentation:** The code lacked sufficient comments and documentation, making it difficult to understand the purpose and functionality of various sections.
- **Unnecessary verbosity and redundancy:** The code contained several redundant lines and unnecessary verbosity, which made it unnecessarily complex and difficult to read.
- **Inconsistent coding standards:** The code did not adhere to consistent coding standards, which could lead to inconsistencies and errors.
- **Excessive code complexity:** The code had several instances of excessive nesting and long methods, which made it difficult to understand and maintain.
- **Unnecessary dependencies:** The code included several unnecessary dependencies, which could bloat the bundle size and introduce potential vulnerabilities.

The following improvements were made to address these issues:

- **Improved comments and documentation:** Added comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of various sections of the code.
- **Simplified code:** Simplified the code by removing redundant lines and unnecessary verbosity to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Enforced coding standards:** Enforced consistent coding standards to ensure consistency and prevent errors.
- **Reduced code complexity:** Reduced code complexity by breaking down long methods and reducing nesting levels.
- **Optimized dependencies:** Optimized dependencies by removing unnecessary ones and replacing them with more efficient alternatives.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.\n
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.\n
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.\n\n
      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will\n
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.\n
