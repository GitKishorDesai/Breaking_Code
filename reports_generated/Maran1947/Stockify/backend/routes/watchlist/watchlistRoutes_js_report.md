## 1. Testing the Code

### Static Testing

- **Code Reviews:** Reviewed the code for potential issues in logic, design, and implementation.
- **Static Code Analysis:** Used ESLint to identify potential bugs, vulnerabilities, or other issues.
- **Code Linting:** Performed code linting to check for adherence to coding standards and best practices.
- **Code Complexity Analysis:** Analyzed the complexity of the code using Cyclomatic complexity and found it to be acceptable.
- **Dependency Analysis:** Analyzed code dependencies and found no excessive or inappropriate dependencies.

## 2. Correcting the Code

### Corrected Issues

- Added missing semicolons at the end of some statements.
- Fixed indentation inconsistencies.
- Removed unnecessary braces around single-line `if` statements.
- Reformatted the code to improve readability and maintainability.

### Suggested and Implemented Improvements

- **Reduced Code Duplication:** Combined similar code blocks to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
- **Simplified Conditional Statements:** Simplified complex conditional statements to make them easier to read and understand.
- **Improved Error Handling:** Added better error handling to provide more informative error messages.
