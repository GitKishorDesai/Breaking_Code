**2. Correcting the Code**

No corrections are necessary.

**3. Detailed Review**

The code is well-written and follows best practices for database connection handling. It uses a MongoDB connection string stored in the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable, ensuring that sensitive information is not stored in the code. The code also handles connection errors gracefully, logging any errors to the console.

**4. Fixed Code**

As no corrections are necessary, the fixed code is the same as the original code:

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const mongoDB = process.env.MONGODB_URI;

mongoose.connect(mongoDB, {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true
})
.then(() => console.log("Mongodb connected successfully..."))
.catch((err) => console.log(err));

module.exports = mongoose;
```
