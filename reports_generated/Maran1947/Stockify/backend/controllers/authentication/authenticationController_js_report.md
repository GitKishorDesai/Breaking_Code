    if (!userId || !password) {
      return res.status(400).json({

    console.log(e);
    res.status(500).json({ status: 500, message: e.message });
  }
};

module.exports.get_trader_by_userId = async (req, res) => {
  const { userId } = req.query;
  try {
    const trader = await User.findOne(
      { _id: userId },
      { _id: 0, __v: 0, createdAt: 0, updatedAt: 0 }

    console.log(err);
    return res.status(500).json({ status: 500, message: err.message });
  }
};
```

The following improvements were made to the code:

- **Improved error handling:** The code now handles errors more gracefully and provides more informative error messages.
- **Improved code readability:** The code has been refactored to make it more readable and maintainable.
- **Improved performance:** Some performance optimizations have been applied to improve the overall performance of the code.
