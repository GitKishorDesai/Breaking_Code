# Breaking Code
This project generates code reports by recursively analyzing the files in a GitHub repository.

## How It Works
The tool scans through all files within a selected GitHub repository.

It analyzes each file and produces detailed reports on the code.

Reports can include metrics, summaries, or insights depending on your requirements.

### Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install required dependencies using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the main application file to generate reports:
```
python app.py
```

Reports will be saved in the reports_generated folder.

### Project Structure
app.py: Main application logic

breaking_backend.py: Backend utilities and code analysis functions

reports_generated/: Output folder for generated reports

requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies

.devcontainer/: Development environment configuration files

testing.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for testing and prototyping

.gitignore, prompt.txt: Supporting files
